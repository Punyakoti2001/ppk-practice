Common Thymeleaf Expressions:
=============================

Selection Expressions (*{...}): Access properties of the selected object (often used in forms).
Conditional Expressions (th:if, th:unless): Conditional rendering.

In JSP, Java code can be written within various tags:

Scriptlet Tag (<% ... %>): Used to write plain Java code within JSP.
Expression Tag (<%= ... %>): Outputs the result of Java expressions directly.
Declaration Tag (<%! ... %>): Declares variables or methods that can be used in the JSP.
