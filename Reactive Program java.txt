To Make Async in server side app we have Feature and CompletableFeature interface.

Ex: code:
==========================
  CompletableFeature<User> userAsync = CompletableFeature.supplyAsync(()->userService.getById(userId));
  CompleatableFeature<UserPreference> userPre = CompletableFeature.supplyAsync(()->userPreferenceService.getPreferencrByUserId(userId));

  CompleatableFeature<Void> bothFeaturs = CompleatableFeature.allOf(userAsync , userPre );
  bothFeaturs.join();
  User user = userAsync.join();
  UserPreference userPreference = userPre.join();

return User; 
=========================

we can have n no.of service calls from the controller. no problem, the waiting will not happen.
